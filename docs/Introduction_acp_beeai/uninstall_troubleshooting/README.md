**Solution:**

1. Check what's running on the port:

    ```shell
    lsof -i :8000
    ```

2. Kill the process if needed, substituting the number in the "PID" column:

    ```shell
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```

3. Or use a different port:

    ```shell
    uv run src/ticket_workflow_agent.py --port 8001
    ```

### BeeAI Platform Won't Start

**Problem:** `beeai platform start` fails

    beeai platform start
    ```

### API Key Issues

**Problem:** Authentication errors or "Invalid API key"

**Solutions:**

1. Reconfigure your LLM provider:

    ```

2. Verify your API key is correctly set in the environment
3. Check that your API key has sufficient credits/quota

### Python/UV Issues

**Problem:** `uv sync` fails or Python dependency errors
